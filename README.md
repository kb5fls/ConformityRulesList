# ConformityRulesList
Python script to extract all supported rules for AWS, Azure, and GCP from Trend Micros Cloud Conformity

The script creates a CSV file that lists associated Rule ID, Rule Title, Rule Category, and Cloud Provider. 

The script is written with the API key set as an environmental variable on your Windows systems. You will need to
set this env variable on your system or modify the Python script to integrate the API key however it 
fits your needs. 

In addition, you will need to change the URL for the API call based on which region you have Conformity
deployed in. 

You will have to change that to match your needs.
