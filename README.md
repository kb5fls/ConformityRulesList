# ConformityRulesList
Python script to extract all supported rules for AWS, Azure, and GCP from Trend Micros Cloud Conformity

The script creates a rules.txt file that lists associated Rule ID, Rule Title, Rule Category, and Cloud Provider. 

The script is written with the API key set as an environmental variable on your Windows systems. 

You will have to change that to match your needs. 

See example format below.
